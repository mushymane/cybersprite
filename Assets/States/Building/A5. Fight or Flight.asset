  storyText: "I've found a large group of these thugs. They have guns are are modded
    to the teeth. It seems like getting through them is the only way out as they're
    the only obstacle before the door. I have three options. I can fight them, which
    seems like a decent challenge, I can distract them, which seems like a slightly
    easier challenge. Or I can see if I can find my way back to the garage. \r\n\r\nWhat's
    the plan?\r\n\r\n1. Show them no mercy.\r\n\r\n2. Hack the lights then rush the
    exit.\r\n\r\n3. Go to the garage."
