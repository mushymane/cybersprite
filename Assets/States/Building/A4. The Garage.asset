  storyText: 'Interestingly there are rust buckets and luxury cars here. Mostly rust
    buckets though. My systems aren''t completely dead so I can try to quickly hack
    a car and drive off into the sunset. Or I can stay on foot and head to the exit.

    

    What''s
    my best option?

    

    1. Drive off in a new car.

    

    2. Drive
    off in a tin can.

    

    3. Stay quiet and head to the exit.'
